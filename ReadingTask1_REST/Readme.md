### 1. What exactly is REST? How does the context of it fits to the title of the dissertation?


  **REST is a webservice that communicates via the http protocol. As well REST is an architectural style defined by the following six constraints:** <br/>
   1.**Client/server:** User interface and data storage are seperated. <br/>
   2. **Stateless:** Each request from the client must contain all necessary information. No context is stored on the server. <br/>
   3. **Cache:** Data within a response to a request must be explicit labeled "cacheable" or "non-cacheable". <br/>
   4. **Uniform interface:** <br/>
   5. **Layered System:** <br/>
   6. **Code-on-demand:** <br/>
