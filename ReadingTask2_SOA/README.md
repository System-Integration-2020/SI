SaaS is a software delivery method

    -SaaS is a category in cloud computing

    -"The resources that are available through SaaS are software applications. The underlying infrastructure for the software is also given to, but hidden from, the users. SaaS is also known as on-demand or hosted software"

SOA is a methodology for designing and automating business processes



---
SOA is a manufacturing model which deals with designing and building software by applying the service oriented computing principles to software solutions, while SaaS is a model for sales and distribution of software applications. In simpler terms, SaaS is a means of delivering software as services over the internet to its subscribers, while SOA is an architectural model in which the smallest unit of logic is a service. So, SOA (an architectural strategy) and SaaS (a business model) cannot be directly compared.
